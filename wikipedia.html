    <p>Telugu cinema, also known as Tollywood, is the segment of Indian cinema dedicated to the production of motion pictures in the Telugu language, widely spoken in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.</p> <p> Telugu cinema is based in <a href="https://housing.com/film-nagar-jubilee-hills-hyderabad-overview-P5z7h52s6p4xhrhkx" target="_blank">Film Nagar, Hyderabad.</a> As of 2021, Telugu cinema is the largest film industry in India in terms of box-office.[6][7] Telugu films sold 23.3 crore (233 million) tickets in 2022, the highest among various film industries in India.[4][5] </p><p>Since 1909, filmmaker <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11354272/" target="_blank"> Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu</a> was involved in producing short films and exhibiting them in different regions of Asia. He established the first Indian-owned movie theatres in South India.[11] In 1921, he produced the silent film, Bhishma Pratigna, generally considered to be the first Telugu feature film. As the first Telugu film exhibitor and producer, he is regarded as the 'Father of Telugu cinema'.[12] The first Telugu film with audible dialogue, Bhakta Prahlada (1932) was directed by H. M. Reddy. In 1933, Sati Savitri directed by C. Pullayya received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice Film Festival.[13] Since its inception, Telugu cinema was known as the pre-eminent centre of mythological films in India.[14] From the late 1930s, films focused on contemporary living and social issues, like Raithu Bidda (1939), were produced and gradually gained prominence.</p>

       <p> Ten Telugu films were featured in CNN-IBN's list of "100 Greatest Indian Films of All Time".[a] Though known for big-ticket films catering to wider audience, Telugu filmmakers have also forayed into parallel and arthouse films.[16] Parallel films like Daasi (1988), Thilaadanam (2000), Vanaja (2006) among others have won accolades at major film festivals including Berlin, Karlovy Vary, Moscow, and Busan.[b] Since the mid-2010s, Telugu cinema has pioneered the pan-Indian film movement, cutting across ethnic and linguistic barriers. Baahubali 2 (2017) won the Saturn Award for Best International Film. RRR (2022) received various international accolades including an Academy Award for the song "Naatu Naatu" and the Critics' Choice Award for Best Foreign Language Film.</p><br><br>

The Tollywood actors are also marked as among the highest-paid ones compared to other regional cinemas, and the movies are often presented with high budgets. Every year, there are several Tollywood movie releases across India and the globe.</p>

<p> With exciting storylines, unique scripts, and overall different genres, the Tollywood industry deserves special mention. So we have worked around bringing you all about the Telugu actors and hero profiles to you today!</p>

    <h1>Directors</h1>
    <p>A film director is a person who controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the film crew and actors in the fulfilment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design and all the creative aspects of filmmaking.[1]</p>

       <p> The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget.</p>
        
       <p> There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, producers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Other directors edit or appear in their films or compose the music score for their films.[2]</p> <center><img src="directors.jpg" alt=""></center><div id="b"><h1>Producers</h1><p>A film producer is a person who oversees film production.[1] Either employed by a production company or working independently, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting the script, coordinating writing, directing, editing, and arranging financing.[2]</p>

       <p> The producer is responsible for finding and selecting promising material for development.[2] Unless the film is based on an existing script, the producer hires a screenwriter and oversees the script's development.[3] These activities culminate with the pitch, led by the producer, to secure the financial backing that enables production to begin. If all succeeds, the project is "greenlighted".</p>
        
       <p> The producer also supervises the pre-production, principal photography and post-production stages of filmmaking. A producer is also responsible for hiring a director for the film, as well as other key crew members. Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production, the producer typically manages logistics and business operations, though some directors also produce their own films. The producer must ensure the film is delivered on time and within budget, and in the latter stages before release, will oversee the marketing and distribution of the film.[4]</p>
        
       <p>Producers cannot always supervise all of the production. In this case, the primary producer or executive producer may hire and delegate work to associate producers, assistant producers, line producers, or unit production managers.[5]</p><center><img src="Producers.webp" alt=""></center><div id="c"><h1>Music Directors</h1><p>The title of "music director" or "musical director" is used by many symphony orchestras to designate the primary conductor and artistic leader of the orchestra. The term "music director" is most common for orchestras in the United States. With European orchestras, the titles of "principal conductor" or "chief conductor" are more common, which designate the conductor who directs the majority of a given orchestra's concerts in a season. <br> In musical theatre and opera, the music director is in charge of the overall musical performance, including ensuring that the cast knows the music thoroughly, supervising the musical interpretation of the performers and pit orchestra, and conducting the orchestra.</p>

      <p>  In the 20th century, the title and position typically brought with it an almost unlimited influence over the particular orchestra's affairs. As implied by the name, the music director not only conducts concerts, but also controls what music the orchestra will perform or record, and has much authority regarding hiring, firing, and other personnel decisions over an orchestra's musicians. Such authoritarian rule, once expected and even thought necessary for a symphonic ensemble to function properly, has loosened somewhat in the closing decades of the 20th century with the advent and encouragement of more power sharing and cooperative management styles (with the orchestra musicians themselves, the administrative staff, and volunteer board of directors). The music director in American lingo also assists with fund-raising, and also is the primary focus of publicity for the orchestra, as what is often called its "public face".[5]</p><center><img src="music directors.jpg" alt=""></center></div></div>
